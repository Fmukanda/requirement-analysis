# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
****
The main purpose of this repository is to document the concept of Requirement Analysis, including its importance in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, and defining the requirements of the software product that meet the needs and expectations of users and stakeholders. This process ensures that the software product being developed is aligned with the goals and requirements all stakeholders during the SDLC.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is  a crucial process in setting out the direction of Software development project. The following are significances of Requirement Analysis in SDLC
 - **Clear Understanding of Objectives:** Requirement analysis prevents misunderstandings and ensures everyone has a shared vision.
 - **Scope Definition:** It helps define the scope of the project, specifying what features are included and prevents scope creep.
 - **Efficient Resource Allocation:** By understanding the requirements upfront, the team can plan the project effectively and allocate resources efficiently.
 - **Reduces Risk:** Properly gathering and documenting requirements helps identify potential risks early on before the development of software product.
 - **Improved Quality:** Clear requirements guide the development, testing, and deployment phases, ensuring the final product meets the desired quality.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
  - **Requirement Gathering:** Collect detailed information through interviews, surveys, workshops, or document analysis to understand user needs, system functionality, and constraints.
  - **Requirement Elicitation:** Engage with stakeholders to clarify ambiguous or incomplete requirements. This often involves discussions to dig deeper into the desired features, performance, and security needs.
  - **Requirement Documentation:** Write down both functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability, etc.) in a clear, structured format.
  - **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Create models to visualize requirements, Analyze and prioritize requirements based on business value, feasibility, and urgency to ensure the most critical needs are addressed first.
  - **Requirement Validation:** Ensure that the documented requirements align with stakeholder expectations and are achievable. This may involve reviewing the requirements with stakeholders for validation.
